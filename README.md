# Twilight Sanctuary 5e
a Foundry VTT macro

This macro rolls temporary hit points (1d6 + cleric level) for all of the selected tokens, and then automatically applies the temporary hit points to each of those tokens.

By default, it is set up to pull the cleric's level. Change `ClericName` to your cleric's name.

There are no bells and whistles (i.e. dialogue boxes), this is meant to be a quick and painless way to roll temporary hit points for Twilight Clerics.
